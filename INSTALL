INSTALLATION
============

To install graffer you must first install gtk-fortran (gtk2 or gtk3)
and plplot (5.9.9 is currently the only version that works as there are
some API changes in SVN). To build the documentation, pdflatex is also
needed.

Build
-----

Create a build directory (e.g. as a subdirectory of the distribution
-- this will be assumed hereafter). 

Change directory to it.

   cmake ..    # To configure the build

If you want to specify which gtk version to use then use

   cmake -DGTK=2 .. 
or
   cmake -DGTK=3 ..

In addition the usual cmake options to select installation paths
etc. are available.

Then:

   make 

to build graffer, and:

   sudo make install

to install it. This will also install some gdl/idl utilities to allow
creation of graffer files from within that environment.

Setting up
----------

In order to use the gdl/idl tools, you need to add their directory to
GDL_PATH (or IDL_PATH). Shell scripts that can be 'source'ed to do this
are installed in ${PREFIX}/share/graffer.
