INSTALLATION
============

To install graffer you must first install gtk-fortran (gtk2 or gtk3)
and plplot (5.9.9 is currently the only version that works as there are
some API changes in SVN).

Build
-----

Create a build directory (e.g. as a subdirectory of the distribution
-- this will be assumed hereafter). 

Change directory to it.

   cmake ..    # To configure the build

If you want to specify which gtk version to use then use

   cmake -DGTK=2 .. 
or
   cmake -DGTK=3 ..

In addition the usual cmake options to select installation paths
etc. are available.

Then:

   make 

to build graffer, and:

   sudo make install

to install it. This will also install some gdl/idl utilities to allow
creation of graffer files from within that environment.
