INSTALLATION
============

Requirements
------------

To install graffer you must first install gtk-fortran (gtk2 or gtk3)
and plplot. To build the documentation, pdflatex is also
needed.

Your Fortran compiler needs to fully support the "iso_c_binding"
intrinsic module, and to apply the C-preprocessor to files with the
suffix ".F90".

You will need cmake to construct the makefiles.

Build
-----

Create a build directory (e.g. as a subdirectory of the distribution
-- this will be assumed hereafter). 

Change directory to it.

   cmake ..    # To configure the build

If you want to specify which gtk version to use then use

   cmake -DGTK=2 .. 
or
   cmake -DGTK=3 ..

In addition the usual cmake options to select installation paths
etc. are available.

Then:

   make 

to build graffer, and:

   sudo make install

to install it. This will also install some gdl/idl utilities to allow
creation of graffer files from within that environment.

Setting up
----------

In order to use the gdl/idl tools, you need to add their directory to
GDL_PATH (or IDL_PATH). Shell scripts that can be 'source'ed to do this
are installed in ${PREFIX}/share/graffer.
