GRAFFER
=======

Graffer is an interactive tool for generating plots of data and/or
functions. 

The original graffer was an IDL program. This version provides most of
the same functionality in a Fortran program using gtk-fortran and
plplot for the GUI and plotting respectively.

To display functions gdl (gnudatalanguage) or IDL is required.
